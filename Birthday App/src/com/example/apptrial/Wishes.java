			"That's how your number is always going to saved on my phone. It has nothing to do with how honest you are, it only reflects how greedy you are, stealing other people's title and all. I remember the first time I met you, with my bell bottoms and all that swag, and you were just like uhhh. I just broke up.  I don't have time for this shit. Let me take the bus in peace! And then remember the time we walked to Imax like super studds! the point is, you were cool once upon a time, except when you were pms-ing. It's your birthday once again, and I think I should get to the point. " +

											" Still not gonna grow facial hair :P But it's your day, so let's do the customary emo post. I admire you" +
											" in a lot of ways actually. You're a really easy person to be around and it doesn't take one long to realise" +
											" that you have nothing but good intentions at heart, for everyone. Just gonna leave out all the names you hate from here :P Also, you're insanely helpful. Even if it's at the cost of yourself. That kind of selfless quality is something that sets you apart and is going to take you a long way. And it really helps that we have a lot in common and share the same interests. If I had to pick a person who'd resemble me the closest in college, it'd be you, hands down. Same wavelength, same ruggedly awesome looks, same pull with the ladies ;) The AIIMS trip helped cement the friendship in stone, you were a nerd before that. And it's been such a pleasure. You've grown as a person (from the youtube video I mean. ' It's very nice ') Haha, but despite all the mystery you create around yourself, I've managed to figure you out. Someone who bottles his emotions up and never lets on what's going inside. You're the poster boy for suffering alone, and that needs to change :) Start giving yourself some credit. You've earned it. Just like a bourneville :D We've had a lot of fun these past few years, a lot of memories, a lot of drunken escapades, a lot of happiness. I wish that continues further down the line, no matter what. We'll have a lot of lonavla trips, a Goa trip, a trip abroad, a lot of insane stuff. But today's the day to raise a glass to you and celebrate you." +
											" Happy Birthday buddy :) Hope you get all the happiness in the world, cause you deserve it.","Hey bro!!!...been so good 2 have u as a friend since almost 3 years nw....so much fun v hv hd...ryt frm the 1st ride in ur new car...2 aiims..den lonavala twice...u r a very smart guy....plus u r so multitalented...here's wishing u many many happy returns of the day!!!!...may all ur wishes get fulfilled." +
